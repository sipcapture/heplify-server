**heplify-server** is a stand-alone **HOMER** capture ingester, which generates statistics and stores to the back-end database, developed in Go, optimized for speed and simplicity. Distributed as a single binary ready to capture TLS and UDP **HEP**, Protobuf encapsulated packets from [heplify](https://github.com/sipcapture/heplify) or any other [HEP](https://github.com/sipcapture/hep) enabled agent, indexing to database and rotating using H5 or H7 table format. **heplify-server** provides precise SIP and RTCP metrics with the help of Prometheus and Grafana. It gives you the possibility to get a global view on your network and individual SIP trunk monitoring.

*TLDR; minimal, stand-alone HOMER capture server without Kamailio or OpenSIPS dependency. It's not as customizeable as Kamailio or OpenSIPS with their configuration language, the focus is simplicity!*

------

### Installation
You have 3 options to get **heplify-server** up and running:

* Download a [release](https://github.com/sipcapture/heplify-server/releases)
* Docker [compose](https://github.com/sipcapture/heplify-server/tree/master/docker/hom5-hep-prom-graf)
* Compile from sources:  
  
  [install](https://golang.org/doc/install) Go 1.11+
